            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3b53f341e9bfa1b291542ff36d386f62/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--KJc-Uo0o--%2Fc_scale%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fssbcmy6vcoq8ggiiinid.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
